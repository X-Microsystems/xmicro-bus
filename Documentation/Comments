>8 slot interrupt vectoring
The backplane is supposed to be able to "override" $XFD to provide an interrupt vector. This would necessitate all cards keep their output buffers disabled on that address which could make them more complex. Not worth it.
Probablhy best to just say vectored interrupts are only available for slot 0-7 and above that it's either a summary interrupt or nothing.

Reserved addresses maybe should also be reduced if they aren't used.
